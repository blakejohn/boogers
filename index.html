      <summary>Macho Madness</summary>
      <p>In June 1985, Savage signed with Vince McMahon. Billed as "the top free agent in pro wrestling", Savage's first 
        appearances on Tuesday Night Titans featured several established managers (including Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, and 
        "Classy" Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage.[5] He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth 
        as his new manager.[5][6] His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone 
        who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, participating in 
        a 16-man tournament. He defeated Ivan Putski,[23] Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat,[23] and the Dynamite Kid[23] before losing by 
        a countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog.[23]</p>

         White Sox farm systems.[5] Savage was 18 when he began playing minor league baseball; one of his teammates on the 1971
