    <h1>Macho Man Randy Savage.</h1>
    <p>Randy Mario Poffo (November 15, 1952 â€“ May 20, 2011), better known by his ring name "<strong>Macho Man</strong>" Randy Savage, 
    was an American professional wrestler and color commentator best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation 
    (WWF, now <abbr arial-label="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE</abbr>) and later World Championship Wrestling (WCW). </p>
    <p>Savage is widely regarded as <em>one of the greatest professional wrestlers</em> in history; a number of peers have 
     ranked Savage among the industry's top performers of all time. He was recognizable by wrestling fans for his 
     distinctively deep and raspy voice, his flamboyant ring attire, intensity exhibited in and out of the ring, using 
     "Pomp and Circumstance" as his entrance music and his signature catch phrase, "<strong>Oooh yeah!</strong>" For most of his 
     tenures in the WWF and WCW, Savage was managed by his real-life wife "Miss Elizabeth" Hulette.</p>
    <p>He won 29 titles during a 32-year career, including the WWF World Heavyweight Championship twice and the WCW World
      Heavyweight Championship four times. A one-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, Savage was named by WWE as
      the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time and was credited for bringing "a higher level of credibility to the
      title through his amazing in-ring performances."</p> 
    <p>Aside from championships, he was the 1987 WWF King of the Ring and the 1995 WCW World War 3 winner. A major pay-per-view
      attraction in the 1980s and 1990s, Savage headlined WrestleManias IV, V and VIII (being part of a double main event at the
      last of those presentations), as well as four of the first five SummerSlam shows, the 1995 edition of WCW's Starrcade,
      and many other events. At the peak of his popularity, he held similar drawing power to that of Hulk Hogan. He was
      posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015.</p>
